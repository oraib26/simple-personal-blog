          <h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>
          <p>Starting my journey into web development was one of the most exciting and challenging experiences of my life.
            <blockquote>It all began during my first year at Kadoorie University. What started as a curiosity quickly turned into a passion as I discovered the endless possibilities of what I could create.</blockquote>
          </p>
        
          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>My first encounter with web development was a simple HTML page. I was fascinated by how I could structure a
            <u>webpage</u> using HTML. As I delved deeper, I learned about CSS and how it could transform a plain HTML page into something visually appealing. The ability to style elements, create layouts, and make a website look attractive was incredibly rewarding.</p>
        
          <h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
          <p>After getting comfortable with HTML and CSS, I moved on to <em>JavaScript</em>. This was a game-changer for me.
            JavaScript brought interactivity to my web pages. I could now create dynamic content, respond to user actions, and build more complex applications. I spent countless hours practicing JavaScript, working on small projects, and solving coding challenges.</p>
        
          <h3>Diving into Back-End Development</h3>
          <p>As my confidence grew, I wanted to understand how the server-side of web applications worked. This led me to learn Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows you to run JavaScript on the server. I started building simple server-side applications and APIs, learning about asynchronous programming, and how to manage server-side code.</p>
        
          <h3>Discovering Express.js</h3>
          <p>To make server-side development easier, I learned Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express.js provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. With Express, I could easily set up routes, handle requests, and manage middleware. This significantly sped up my development process and made it easier to build scalable applications.</p>
